# Laravel -- The task

Getting to know the server-side MVC frameworks, and within that, our chosen framework, Laravel, is done through the development of a specific application. In the application, the logged-in user can keep track of their music projects, each project has music tracks, and for each track, we can apply the desired filters. The application consists of the following draft functions:

- main page: some important information about the project
- a help page where we can transpose a music note
- project list page
- add a new project
- edit and delete a project
- project details: the tracks belonging to the project and the list of applied filters for each track are displayed here
- add a new track to the project
- track editing and deleting
- user registration, login, logout functions
- proper authorization: all users only have access to the data they have recorded.

We develop the application step by step:

1. Generating the output
2. Input data, form processing
3. Data storage: database and models
4. Data storage: relationships between models
5. Authentication and authorization
6. Additional features: file upload and AJAX
