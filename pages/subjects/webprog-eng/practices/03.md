4. We store the title, year of release, length, and director for a few movies.

    a. Since there are many films, we would like to have a user interface where only a movie title that contains the text written in the filter box appears in a list.

    b. Hovering the title of the movie, we would like to see all the details of the movie.

5. Make a memory game!

    a. Store numbers in the even number of cells, and find the pairs by turning over only two cards at a time! 
    
    b. Count how many steps you can solve the game! 
    
    c. Make it possible to play with more players, in this case indicate who has the turn!

1. Make a hang-man game! Select a word from a baked-in list, and then draw as many letter boxes as the length of the word. Show a row of buttons where we can guess the individual letters. If the selected letter is right, show the letters in the their positions. If we were wrong, count the incorrect attempts. If it reaches a predefined value, we lose. If all the letters of the word have been revealed, we win! In addition to the counter, we can draw the hang-man with SVG elements!

1. A range input field is given.

    a. Dragging the slider, display the value of the slider next to the field.

    b. Dragging the slider, display the value above the slider.
