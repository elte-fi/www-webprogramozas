AJAX services
-------------------

You cand find open APIs here:
- [List of open APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
- [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/)

Most APIs can be used when we sign up for it. It is worth looking for APIs to which you can use freely, or just an `apikey` is required. Be careful with the RapidAPI site, because in Freemium services you have to pay when you exceed the limit! This is written in the [documentation](https://docs.rapidapi.com/docs/api-pricing). It is worth finding an API which is Free, or Freemium with hard limit set.

Another solution is that we save the API answers for each endpoint to files, and we read those on AJAX calls. With this, testing will be easier as well.

The AJAX requests can be made by `XMLHttpRequest` or the `fetch` API!

Tasks
-----

1. Create a web page, where you can give an address, and it tells you the actual weather of that place, a weather forecast, or even historical weather data.

    For this task, we need two services to use:
    - As the weather API works with lateral and longitudal coordinates, first we need to determine where the address is. For this we will use the [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Overview/) service, which can be used without registration.
    - Weather information is provided by [OpenWeatherMaps](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) service. For this to use we need to [register]((https://openweathermap.org/price#weather)), and call the endpoints with the API key.

    Steps:

    - a. Investigate the APIs! Get an API key where needed! Do some request attempts, and save them to files! Later you can use these files for development and tests.
    - b. Geographical coordinates. In an input box, ask an address, and by clicking a button get the coordinates. Put the coordinates into two editable input boxes!
    - c. Weather informations. The coordinates should be in input boxes. Clicking a button will get the weather informations about that place and diplay them. [See the description of the API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to understand the answer. [Display icons](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions#How-to-get-icon-URL) as well.
    - d. Finally do the previous two steps at once.
